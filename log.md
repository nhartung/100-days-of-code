# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a [blog site](https://nhartung.github.io/) using Jeykll. I'll my blog to provide occasional larger updates.

**Thoughts:** Although it's not related to my 100DaysOfCode, I found building a site with Jeykll to be extremely intuitive and simple. This will be my path in the future for basic blogs and web pages.
