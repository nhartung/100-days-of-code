# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a [blog site](https://nhartung.github.io/) using Jeykll. I'll my blog to provide occasional larger updates.

**Thoughts:** Although it's not related to my 100DaysOfCode, I found building a site with Jeykll to be extremely intuitive and simple. This will be my path in the future for basic blogs and web pages.

### Day 1: August 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about using Light2D and LightOccluder2D. Started to play around with a playable character and movement.

**Thoughts:** The built in Light2D and LightOccluder2D functionality is extremely easy to use. With the plan that I have now, my game will incorporate lighting heavily. Knowing that there is an easy to use framework in place for lighting gives me hope that some of the concepts I hope to implement will not be very difficult. Starting messing around with player movement. I'm not sure yet if I want to use the built in KinematicBody2D movement or roll my own in an Area2D. I'll likely go with the latter, as it's what my prior experience is, and I don't think I need the capabilities of KinematicBody2D for what I hope to create.
